Sure! Here's an updated README for your experimental virtual assistant prototype with a focus on the speech recognition aspect. This can be useful for documentation or sharing your project with others.

# Experimental Virtual Assistant - Prototype

This is a **voice command virtual assistant** built entirely in Python. It leverages various Python libraries to provide a functional prototype capable of performing tasks such as voice recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, web searches, news retrieval, weather forecasting, and more.

## Features

- **Voice Command Input**: The assistant listens to voice commands using speech recognition.
- **Speech-to-Text**: The assistant converts spoken words into text commands using the **Google Speech Recognition** engine.
- **Text-to-Speech**: The assistant responds verbally using the **pyttsx3** library for text-to-speech conversion.
- **Common Functions**:
  - Play songs on YouTube
  - Tell the current time and date
  - Tell jokes
  - Perform basic arithmetic calculations
  - Set reminders
  - Fetch the latest news headlines
  - Open commonly used applications (Notepad, Calculator, Chrome, etc.)
  - Fetch the weather information for any city
  - Look up information on Wikipedia

## Libraries Used

- **SpeechRecognition**: For recognizing speech commands and converting them to text.
- **pyttsx3**: For converting text to speech.
- **pywhatkit**: For YouTube song search and playback.
- **datetime**: For fetching the current time and date.
- **wikipedia**: For looking up information on various topics.
- **requests**: For fetching weather and news data from APIs.
- **tkinter**: For the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **os**: For interacting with the operating system (opening applications).
- **math**: For basic calculations.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** or download the files to your local machine.

2. **Install dependencies**:
   You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pywhatkit wikipedia requests pyAudio
   ```

3. **API Keys**:
   You will need an API key for the **OpenWeather** API (for weather functionality) and **NewsAPI** (for news retrieval). You can obtain them by signing up on their respective websites:

   - [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
   - [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)

4. **Install PyAudio**:
   `PyAudio` is a dependency for the **SpeechRecognition** library that handles microphone input.

   On Windows, you can use:

   ```bash
   pip install pipwin
   pipwin install pyaudio
   ```

   On macOS and Linux, you can install it directly:

   ```bash
   pip install pyaudio
   ```

5. **Run the Program**:
   Once all the dependencies are installed, you can start the assistant by running:

   ```bash
   python assistant.py
   ```

## How to Use

- Simply press the **Submit** button in the GUI or wait for the assistant to start listening for voice commands.
- Commands such as "play music," "what's the time," "tell me a joke," or "set a reminder" will trigger specific actions.
- The assistant will respond both verbally and in the GUI's text box.

### Sample Commands

- "Joey, play music"
- "What is the weather in London?"
- "Tell me a joke"
- "What is the square root of 16?"
- "Set a reminder to buy groceries"
- "What's the news today?"
- "Open Chrome"
- "Who is Albert Einstein?"

## How the Voice Recognition Works

The assistant listens for a specific wake word, such as "Joey", and then captures the rest of the user's speech. Here's how it works:

1. **Microphone Capture**: The assistant listens to the user's voice input using the **SpeechRecognition** library.
2. **Speech-to-Text**: Once the wake word ("Joey") is detected, the assistant processes the audio and converts it to text using Google's Speech Recognition engine.
3. **Command Processing**: The assistant matches the recognized text with predefined commands and performs actions such as fetching the weather or opening an app.
4. **Speech Feedback**: Once a command is executed, the assistant responds verbally using the **pyttsx3** library.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Speech Recognition Issues**:

   - Ensure your microphone is working and properly connected.
   - Ensure there is minimal background noise for better accuracy.
   - If the assistant is not recognizing your voice correctly, try speaking more clearly or adjusting the microphone sensitivity.

2. **Missing API Keys**:

   - If you're using the weather or news features, ensure you've added valid API keys in the code. Replace the placeholder text (`"_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY"`, `"YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY"`) with your actual keys.

3. **Audio Libraries**:
   - If you encounter issues with `PyAudio`, make sure it's properly installed and compatible with your system.

## Future Enhancements

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enhance command recognition and understanding.
- **Multiple Wake Words**: Support multiple wake words like "Assistant," "Hey Joey," etc.
- **More Integrations**: Add more services, such as calendar events, email management, and IoT device control.
